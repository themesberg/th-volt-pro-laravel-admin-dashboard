# Installation

## Prerequisites

If you don't already have an Apache local environment with PHP and MySQL, use one of the following links:

 - Windows: https://updivision.com/blog/post/beginner-s-guide-to-setting-up-your-local-development-environment-on-windows
 - Linux: https://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-install-lamp-on-ubuntu
 - Mac: https://wpshout.com/quick-guides/how-to-install-mamp-on-your-mac/

Also, you will need to install Composer: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md

## Laravel
1. Download the project’s zip then copy and paste volt-dashboard-master folder in your projects folder. Rename the folder to your project’s name
2. Make sure you have Node and Composer locally installed.
3.Run the following command in order to download all the project dependencies. `composer install`
4. In your terminal run `npm install`
5. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and updated the configurations (mainly the database configuration)
6. In your terminal run `php artisan key:generate`
7. Run `php artisan migrate --seed` to create the database tables and seed the roles and users tables
8. Run `php artisan storage:link` to create the storage symlink (if you are using **Vagrant** with **Homestead** for development, remember to ssh into your virtual machine and run the command from there).

## Usage

To start testing the theme, register as a user or log in using one of the default users:

<ul>
<li>admin type - <strong><a href="mailto:admin@paper.com">admin@paper.com</a></strong> with the password <strong>secret</strong></li>
<li>creator type - <strong><a href="mailto:creator@paper.com">creator@paper.com</a></strong> with the password <strong>secret</strong></li>
<li>member type - <strong><a href="mailto:member@paper.com">member@paper.com</a></strong> with the password <strong>secret</strong></li>
</ul>

Make sure to run the migrations and seeders for the above credentials to be available.
In addition to the features included in the free preset, the Pro theme also has a role management example with an updated user management, as well as tag management, category management and item management examples. All the necessary files (controllers, requests, views) are installed out of the box and all the needed routes are added to <code>routes/web.php</code>. Keep in mind that all the features can be viewed once you log in using the credentials provided above or by registering your own user.
Each role has a different privilege level and can perform a certain number of actions according to this level.

A <strong>member type</strong> user can log in, update his profile and view a list of added items.

A <strong>creator type</strong> user can log in, update his profile and perform actions on categories, tags and items.

A <strong>admin type</strong> user can log in, update his profile and perform actions on categories, tags, items, roles and users.

### Dashboard

You can access the dashboard either by using the "**Dashboard**" link in the left sidebar or by adding **/dashboard** in the URL.

### User Profile

You have the option to edit the current logged in user's profile information (name, email, profile picture) and password. To access this page, just click the "**Profile**" link in the left sidebar or add **/profile** in the URL.

The `app/Http/Livewire/Profile.php` handles the update of the user information and password.

```
    public function mount() { $this->user = auth()->user(); }

    public function save()
    {
        $this->validate();

        $this->user->save();

        $this->showSavedAlert = true;
            
        }
    }
```

If you input the wrong data when editing the profile, don't worry. Validation rules have been added to prevent this.

```
    protected $rules = [
        'user.first_name' => 'max:15',
        'user.last_name' => 'max:20',
        'user.birthday' => 'date_format:Y-m-d',
        'user.email' => 'email',
        'user.phone' => 'numeric',
        'user.gender' => '',
        'user.address' => 'max:20',
        'user.number' => 'numeric',
        'user.city' => 'max:20',
        'user.zip' => 'numeric',
    ];

```

### Sign in

You have the option to log in using the email and password. To access this page, just click the "**Laravel examples / Sign in**" link in the left sidebar or add **/sign-in** in the URL.

The `app/Http/Livewire/Auth/SignIn.php` handles the log in process and validation.

```
   protected $rules = [
        'email' => 'required|email',
        'password' => 'required',
    ];

    public function login()
    {
        $credentials = $this->validate();
        return auth()->attempt($credentials)
                ? redirect()->intended('/profile')
                : $this->addError('email', trans('auth.failed'));
    }
```

### Sign up

You have the option to register an user using the email and password. To access this page, just click the "**Laravel examples / Sign up**" link in the left sidebar or add **/sign-up** in the URL.

The `app/Http/Livewire/Auth/SignUp.php` handles the register process and validation.

```
    public function register()
    {
        $this->validate([
            'email' => 'required',
            'password' => 'required|same:passwordConfirmation|min:6',
        ]);

        $user = User::create([
            'email' =>$this->email,
            'password' => Hash::make($this->password),
            'remember_token' => Str::random(10),
        ]);

        auth()->login($user);

        return redirect('/profile');
    }
```
### Forgot password

You have the option to send an email containing the password reset link to an user. To access this page, just click the "**Laravel examples / Forgot password**" link in the left sidebar or add **/forgot-password** in the URL.

The `app/Http/Livewire/ForgotPassword.php` handles the email submission process.

```
    public function recoverPassword() {
        $this->validate();
        $user=User::where('email', $this->email)->first();
        $this->notify(new ResetPassword($user->id));
        $this->mailSentAlert = true;
        }
    }
```

The `app/Notifications/ResetPassword.php` handles the email submission itself. Here you can edit the overall layout of the email.
```
    public function toMail($notifiable)
    {
        $url = URL::signedRoute('reset-password', ['id' => $this->token]);
        return (new MailMessage)
                    ->subject('Reset your password')
                    ->line('Hey, did you forget your password? Click the button to reset it.')
                    ->action('Reset Password', $url)
                    ->line('Thank you for using our application!');
    }

```

### Reset password

The email sent through the forgot password process will send the user to an unique link containing the password reset form. To access an example of this page, just click the "**Laravel examples / Reset password**" link in the left sidebar or add **/reset-password-example** in the URL.

The `app/Http/Livewire/ResetPassword.php` handles the password reset process and validation.

```

    public function resetPassword() {
        $this->validate();
        $existingUser = User::where('email', $this->email)->first();
        if($existingUser && $existingUser->id == $this->urlId) {
            $existingUser->update([
                'password' => Hash::make($this->password)
            ]);
            $this->isPasswordChanged = true;
            $this->wrongEmail = false;
        }
        else {
            $this->wrongEmail = true;
        }
    }
    
```

### Role Management

The Pro theme allows you to add user roles. By default, the theme comes with Admin, Creator and Member roles. To access the role management example click the **“Laravel Examples/Role Management”** link in the left sidebar or add /roles to the URL. Here you can add/edit new roles. To add a new role click the “Add role” button and to edit an existing role click the dotted menu (available on every table line) and then click “Edit”. In both cases, you will be directed to a form which allows you to modify the name and description of a role


The policy which authorizes the user to access the role management option is implemented in `App\Policies\RolePolicy.php.`

```

    public function render() {
        return view('livewire.roles', [
            roles' => Role::searchMultipleRoles($this->fields, $this->search)
                    ->orderBy($this->sortField, $this->sortDirection)
                    ->paginate($this->entries),
        ]);
    }
  
    
```

### User Management

The theme comes with an out of the box user management option. To access this option ,click the **“Laravel Examples/User Management”** link in the left sidebar or add /users to the URL. The first thing you will see is a list of existing users. You can add new ones by clicking the “Add user” button (above the table on the right). On the Add user page, you will find a form which allows you to fill out the user`s name, email, role and password. All pages are generated using blade templates:


```

<div class="col-md-12 mb-3">
    <div>
        <label for="name">{{__('Name')}}</label>
        <input wire:model="name" class="form-control @error('name') is-invalid @enderror" id="name"
            type="text" placeholder="Name" required>
    </div>
    @error('name') <div class="invalid-feedback">{{ $message }}</div> @enderror
</div>
  
    
```
Validation rules were added to prevent errors in the form fields (see `App\Http\Livewire\NewUser.php`). Note that these validation rules also apply for the user edit option.

```

protected function rules()
    {
        return [
            'email' => 'email|required|unique:users',
            'first_name' => 'max:15',
            'last_name' => 'max:20',
            'phone' => '',
            'status' => '',
            'role_id' => ['required', Rule::in(collect(DB::table('roles')->pluck('id')))],
            'password' => 'required|min:6|same:passwordConfirmation',
            'upload' => 'nullable|image|max:5000'
        ];
}
  
    
```

### Tag Management

The Pro theme also comes with a tag management option. To access this example, click the **“Laravel Examples/Tag Management”** link in the left sidebar or add /tags to the URL. In this section you can add and edit tags, but you can only delete them if they are not attached to any items. You can add new ones by clicking the “Add tag” button (above the table on the right). You will then be directed to a form which allows you to add new tags. Although you can add in the form only the name and color of a tag, you can write your own migrations to extend this functionality.


```

public function delete($id)
    {
        $this->tag = Tag::find($id);
        if (count($this->tag->items) < 1) {
            $this->tag->delete();
            $this->showFailNotification = false;
            $this->showSuccessNotification = true;
        } else {
            $this->showSuccessNotification = false;
            $this->showFailNotification = true;
        }
    }
  
    
```

The policy which authorizes the user to access tags management pages is implemented in `App\Policies\TagPolicy.php.`

### Category Management

Out of the box you will have an example of category management (for the cases in which you are developing a blog or a shop). To access this example, click the “Laravel Examples/Category Management” link in the left sidebar or add /categories to the URL. You can add and edit categories here, but you can only delete them if they are not attached to any items.

The policy which authorizes the user on categories management pages is implemented in `App\Policies\CategoryPolicy.php.`


```

public function render()
          {
              return view('livewire.categories', [
                  'categories' => Category::searchMultipleRoles($this->fields, $this->search)
                                ->orderBy($this->sortField, $this->sortDirection)
                                ->paginate($this->entries),
              ]);
          }
  
    
```

### Item Management

Item management is the most advanced example included in the Pro theme, because every item has a picture, belongs to a category and has multiple tags. To access this example click the **“Laravel Examples/Item Management”** link in the left sidebar or add `/items` to the URL. Here you can manage the items. A list of items will appear once you start adding them (to access the add page click “Add item”). On the add page, besides the Name and Description fields (which are present in most of the CRUD examples) you can see a category dropdown, which contains the categories you added, a file input and a tag multi select. If you did not add any categories or tags, please go to the corresponding sections (category management, tag management) and add some.


```

            $item = Item::create([
                'name' => $this->name,
                'category_id' => $this->category_id,
                'excerpt' => $this->excerpt,
                'description' => $this->description,
                'date' => $this->date,
                'status' => $this->status,
                'show_on_homepage' => $this->showOnHomepage,
                'options' => $this->options
            ]);
  
    
```
